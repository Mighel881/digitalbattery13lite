<b>Developer notes</b>
This is the Lite version of DigitalBattery13 containing fewer options.
It's the original dream come true, with simple and effective options, so please direct feature requests at the full version.
Recommended settings: change your font settings to suit your device/needs, enable all color toggles and in Extras I have all enabled except Sound.
It will only show on the StatusBar and nowhere else.
Want more options? Use DigitalBattery13
Enjoy!
