<b>Smart Battery Case Support</b>

Works by combining both device and case charge levels and displays in the statusbar like normal.
To enable simply turn it on in the settings.
<br><br>
<b>It doesn't update dynamicaly</b><br>
Currently the combined percentage will only be true when: device percentage goes up or down, or at timer interval (when main device is full)<br>
<i>there is an input field to change the frequency it updates, and an incative toggle to always use the timer even when device is not full.</i>

Feedback on this new support would be great
